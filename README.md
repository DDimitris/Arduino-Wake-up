# Arduino Wakeup App
This is a simple application that initialy was designed in order to make "GET" requests to an Arduino UNO, which is 
connected to the motherboard of a Desktop computer, thus turning on the computer remotely. It is pretty clear that the security concerns
are huge but if you keep the address and port of the Arduino only for your self then you can be safe on some level.

### Important note:
This application uses the **org.apache.httpcomponents:httpclient:4.5** library which is tested with the android SDK 22. (Yeah i know
this application is old. Is the first Android application that i have created. :P)

This is a screenshot of the application:
